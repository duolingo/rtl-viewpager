# RtlViewPager
`RtlViewPager` is built on top of `ViewPager` which is provided as part of the
[AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx).
It extends the functionality of `ViewPager` such that when the layout direction is right to left, pages scroll accordingly.
`RtlViewPager` fully supports data set changes, interoperation with tab strips, and saving and restoring state on screen rotation
and other configuration changes.  Although RTL support has been present as part of Android since version 4.2, the `ViewPager`
implementation in the support library does not.
